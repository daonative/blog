prologe.press is a platform that inverts the classical flow of content creation. Readers crowdsource call for articles and can have a stake in the articles' success.

We're building prologe.press to improve the lives of both readers & writers.

Readers deserve **more nuanced information sources**, not the monolithic thinking that is offered by traditional newspapers. Readers deserve to get a stake in the content's success if they participate in its funding.

Writers deserve fair **compensation** & **protection**. Today, many writers are afraid to share their opinions online for fear of prosecution. And, if you're a small unknown writer, making money out of your writing is downright impossible.

Using prologe.press:

- we **protect** writers by allowing to fund pseudonymous contributors
- we **compensate fairly** by having readers fund & demand articles, not looking at the writer's credentials
- we enable the creation of **more nuanced information sources** by using censorship-resistant technology
- we allow readers to get a **stake in the content's success** by owning a share of the funded content

All of this wasn't possible a few years ago. But today the idea is ripe because of two main reasons:

- Newspapers on both sides of the aisle have been radicalized, leaving people hungry for more nuanced information.
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations have normalized pseudonymous funding in the crypto community, and we think this is just the beginning.
